Web UI Template
============

A simple template for a front end application that uses babel to transpile back
to ES5 and webpack to bundle the application.

This template includes a basic set up for a hot reloading dev environment, and a
basic webpack/babel set up.

Built by following this [SitePoint tutorial](https://www.sitepoint.com/es6-babel-webpack/).

I created this to build a client side application that uses
[Knockout.js](https://knockoutjs.com/) for part of a side project.

**NOTE: Leftpad here is just an example of arbitrary javascript being loaded.

## Instructions

1. clone the repo
2. move the files to the new application's directory
3. `rm -rf .git && git init`
